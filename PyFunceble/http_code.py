This submodule will provide HTTP Code extraction logic and interface..


PyFunceble is the little sister of Funceble (https://github.com/funilrys/funceble)
which was archived on March 13th, 2018.
At the end of 2017, PyFunceble was described by one of its most active user as:
"[an] excellent script for checking ACTIVE and INACTIVE domain names."

Our main objective is to test domains and IP availability
by generating an accurate result based on results from WHOIS, NSLOOKUP and
HTTP status codes.
As result, PyFunceble returns 3 status: ACTIVE, INACTIVE and INVALID.
The denomination of those statuses can be changed under your personal
`config.yaml`.

At the time we write this, PyFunceble is running actively and daily under 50+
Travis CI repository or process to test the availability of domains which are
present into hosts files, AdBlock filter lists, list of IP, list of domains or
blocklists.

An up to date explanation of all status can be found at https://git.io/vxieo.
You can also find a simple representation of the logic behind PyFunceble at
